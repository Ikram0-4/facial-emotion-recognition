# Facial Emotion Recognition

Facial emotion detection from images using the [**FER2013**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) dataset and a **CNN** model.  
Potential application: adapting user interfaces based on the detected emotion.

## Project Description

This project aims to recognize human emotions from facial images using **computer vision** and **deep learning** techniques.  
It leverages the **FER2013** dataset to train a classification model capable of identifying emotions such as:

- Happiness
- Sadness
- Anger
- Surprise
- Disgust
- Fear
- Neutral

The trained model can be used to adapt user interfaces, for example by adjusting content or layout based on the user's emotional state.
